# Building fast web application using Astro

A static site generator is a tool that generates an entirely static HTML website from raw data and a collection of templates. A static site generator, in essence, automates the job of writing individual HTML pages and makes those sites ready to deliver to users ahead of time.
This tutorial will teach a new static site generator for building fast web applications. You'll create a static blog application using Astro at the end of this tutorial.

Let's get to it.


## What is Astro

Astro is a new static site builder with a robust developer experience that meets light output for the modern web. Astro uses a current server-side templating language that renders directly to HTML & CSS, eliminating heavy JavaScript automatically, and the first site builder to eliminate dead code from your website and only hydrate your basic, interactive UI.

> Note: Astro is still beta software. Therefore, missing features and bugs are expected! The developers are still working towards a stable, production-ready v1.0 release.


## Prerequisites
Ensure you have `Node.js - 14.15.0, v16.0.0, or higher` to get started.


## Scaffold new Project
Let's create a new project with the command below:

```
mkdir my-astro-project && cd $_ 
npm create astro@latest
```

The above command will create a `my-astro-project` folder and prompt for the configuration for the project. Your selection should look like the one on the screenshot below:

After selecting the configuration for your project, change directory into the project directory and start the application with the command below:

```
cd my-astro-site && npm run dev
```

You should the output on the screenshot below on your terminal.

Now navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` on your browser. You'd see the Astro welcome as shown on the screenshot below.

After going through the prompts in the Astro create command, Astro will create the folder structure below:

ðŸ“¦my-astro-site
 â”£ ðŸ“‚.git
 â”£ ðŸ“‚public
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œfavicon.ico
 â”£ ðŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œLayout.astro
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚pages
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œindex.astro
 â”£ ðŸ“œ.gitignore
 â”£ ðŸ“œ.npmrc
 â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
 â”£ ðŸ“œastro.config.mjs
 â”£ ðŸ“œpackage-lock.json
 â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
 â”— ðŸ“œtsconfig.json
 
 
## Create Components
Let's create our porject component. Before get started, we'll delete the boilerpaltes in our
