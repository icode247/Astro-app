# Building fast web application using Astro

A static site generator is a tool that generates an entirely static HTML website from raw data and a collection of templates. A static site generator, in essence, automates the job of writing individual HTML pages and makes those sites ready to deliver to users ahead of time.
This tutorial will teach a new static site generator for building fast web applications. You'll create a static blog application using Astro at the end of this tutorial.

Let's get to it.


## What is Astro

Astro is a new static site builder with a robust developer experience that meets light output for the modern web. Astro uses a current server-side templating language that renders directly to HTML & CSS, eliminating heavy JavaScript automatically, and the first site builder to eliminate dead code from your website and only hydrate your basic, interactive UI.

> Note: Astro is still beta software. Therefore, missing features and bugs are expected! The developers are still working towards a stable, production-ready v1.0 release.


## Prerequisites
Ensure you have `Node.js - 14.15.0, v16.0.0, or higher` to get started.
